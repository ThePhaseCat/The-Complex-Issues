# Is the project open-source?

It's not open-source at this time. Also, my code is bad and extremely messy so I don't know why you would want to use my code lol

Go to the issues tab and follow the bug template!

# How can I suggest changes/give feedback?

While I am not sure if I will add more content, I'm happy to get any feedback that could help with future projects!
